// This is a demonstration of Langton’s Ant

// Adapted by Kris Kowal <kris@cixar.com>
//
// With one lobster, this is a faithful representation of Langton’s Ant,
// implemented as a cellular automaton instead of a single-agent automaton.
// However, there are additional rules that dictate the behavior of collisions.
// Each lobster has a unique priority.
// Each lobster makes a bid to follow the course set out for them by the
// langton rule number beneath them.
// For each tile, the neighboring lobster with the highest priority that has
// bid to move onto that tile advances.
// All lobsters that fail their bid turn in place instead.
