<h1 class="title">Using Lobster from the command line</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h2>
<p>If you have a file <code>helloworld.lobster</code> that contains</p>
<pre><code>print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>then running it like so will compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>bin/lobster helloworld.lobster</code></pre>
<h2 id="command-line-options">Command line options</h2>
<p>Format: <code>lobster [ OPTIONS ] [ FILE ] [ -- ARGS ]</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>FILE</code> : main Lobster file to compile &amp;
run.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-- ARGS</code> pass args to the running Lobster program,
available from <code>command_line_arguments()</code>. Must be last on
the command-line.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--pak</code> : generates a pakfile (currently always called
“<code>default.lpak</code>”) in the same folder as the
<code>.lobster</code> file it reads, and doesn’t run the program
afterwards. If you run lobster with no arguments at all, it will try to
load “<code>default.lpak</code>” from the same folder it resides in.
Thus distributing programs created in lobster is as simple as packaging
up the lobster executable with a pakfile. The pakfile contains the
bytecode, and any data files you have specified with the
<code>pakfile</code> keyword, see “Distributing Lobster programs” in the
<a href="implementation.html">implementation</a> documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--cpp</code> : compiles to a .cpp file. Please make sure to
follow <a href="implementation.html">implementation</a> on how to use
this feature. Useful if you’ve created something in Lobster that could
use a bit more speed, for a shipping build. Not recommend to be used
during development.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--import RELDIR</code> specifies a dir relative to FILE
from which <code>import</code> (and <code>pakfile</code>) statements can
be resolved, or any loading the running program does. Does the same as
adding <code>import from "RELDIR"</code> to the top of your
program.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--runtime-shipping</code> : Compile with asserts
off.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--runtime-asserts</code> : Compile with asserts on
(default).</p></li>
<li><p><code>--runtime-verbose</code> : Compile with asserts on + line
info + function tracking for better runtime errors (stack traces) and
profiling. Small effect on speed. <code>--runtime-debug</code> : Same as
verbose, but now tones inlining way down to get better stack traces.
Larger effect on speed. Automatically breaks into the graphical debugger
on assertion failures.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--main MAIN</code> : after compiling FILE, if present,
compile this file and run it. This is useful when running Lobster from
an editor, where you may be editing a module that is not the main file,
would like to see that it compiles by itself, but to run it need to be
launching the main Lobster program it belongs to
(e.g. <code>main.lobster</code> in the same folder).</p></li>
<li><p><code>--wait</code> : makes the compiler wait for commandline
input before it exits. Useful in Windows batch files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--noconsole</code> : Close console window
(Windows)</p></li>
<li><p><code>--verbose</code> : verbose mode, outputs additional stats
about the program being compiled/run. <code>--debug</code> outputs even
more, only useful for working on the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--silent</code> : Only output errors.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--gen-builtins-html</code> : dumps a help file of all
builtin functions the compiler knows about to
<code>builtin_functions_reference.html</code>.
<code>--gen-builtins-names</code> dumps a plain text list of functions,
useful for adding to syntax highlighting files etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--parsedump</code> : dumps internal representations of the
program as AST, and <code>--disasm</code> for a readable bytecode dump.
Only useful for compiler development or if you are really
curious.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--non-interactive-test</code> : Quit after running 1 frame.
Useful for running graphical programs as part of a test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--query</code>: Ask the compiler to answer a query about
definitions in the program being compiled. When is this mode, the
compiler does not try to do a full compilation, but simply tries to
answer the query, including ignoring errors or aborting half-way if it
has to. This option is for use by an IDE or LSP server implementation.
All further args are passed to the query. The first arg is the kind of
query (e.g. <code>definition</code> or <code>complete</code>). The
second arg is the file this query should take place in (as a relative
path, i.e <code>foo/bar.lobster</code>). The 3rd arg is the line where
the query should happen. The 4th arg is the identifier the query is
about. The rest of the args depend on the query type, if any. For
<code>definition</code> a response will be the location of the
definition. For <code>complete</code>, it will return a list of possible
fields/methods.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="default-directories">Default directories</h2>
<p>It’s useful to understand the directories lobster uses, both for
reading source code files and any data files the program may use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the root repo directory: This is the main folder that has the
default <code>bin modules data docs samples tests</code> folders inside
of it.</p></li>
<li><p>the auxiliary directory: this is where the main
<code>.lobster</code> file being compiled resides.</p></li>
<li><p>the directory for writing files: the same as auxiliary on desktop
platforms, but often a special directory on mobile platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux additionally it can load files from
<code>/usr/share/lobster/</code> (or whatever path was configured for
install by CMake, see <code>DATADIR</code>) if the above paths don’t
work. This is to allow package managers to install Lobster in the system
directories.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if any of these folders contains a <code>modules</code>
directory, it will load source code from there as well.</p>
<p>Any of the Lobster builtin commands that load data files specify
paths relative to either the main or auxiliary directories (and either /
or  may be used as path separators). If you package up a Lobster program
for distribution, all these files can be packed into a pakfile, see
<code>--pak</code>.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Running lobster may result in a compiler error, that generally look
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>mygame.lobster(960): error: unknown identifier: highscor</code></pre>
<p>If compiled correctly, running will give you output from your own
print statements, and additionally at some point may cause a runtime
error, which can look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>pythtree.lobster(15): VM error: division by zero
in block -&gt; pythtree.lobster(16)
   i = 0
in block -&gt; pythtree.lobster(16)
in function: branch -&gt; pythtree.lobster(29)
   poly = [[1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000]:xyzw, [-1.000000, ...]:xyzw, ....]
   len = 4
   scale = 0.700000
   max = 11.000000
   n = 0
in block -&gt; pythtree.lobster(29)</code></pre>
<p>This is called a stack trace. Besides the error and the line it
happened on, it will show all functions and blocks that called that
code, in reverse order, with any local variables and their values. This
helps you get an idea where the problem came from and helps in
debugging.</p>
