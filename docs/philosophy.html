<h1 class="title">Lobster Design Philosophy, History, and Future</h1>
</header>
<p>This document tries to clarify why certain design choices were made
in the Lobster language and system.</p>
<p>NOTE: this may be a little out of date. Lobster has evolved a lot
since I wrote this.</p>
<h3 id="primary-motivation">Primary Motivation</h3>
<p>The most important over-arching reason behind everything in Lobster
was to make it a pleasant language to use for one single person: me, the
author. I’ve designed a fair number of languages in the past that had a
particular goal or should appeal to a particular target group, or were
even commercial. Lobster is not such a language.</p>
<p>Unlike past work, its goal from the start wasn’t to try to appeal to
anyone in particular. If you happen to like Lobster, then
congratulations, your taste in programming is probably similar to
mine.</p>
<p>Besides being useful to me, creating Lobster in itself was merely
meant to be a fun project. I love creating programming languages, but
there’s really no money in it, and generally to most people new
programming languages are not desirable things, which is what had
stopped me for a while creating any more of them. Lobster was the “screw
it, I am making one because it’s fun” project. That, and I had some new
ideas about some subtle features that would make a language suitable for
my style of programming (heavily refactoring-based).</p>
<h3 id="what-lobster-is-not">What Lobster is not:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A popular / mainstream language. For that, I’ve made far too many
peculiar choices already, in particular in relation to its syntax (very
terse, not C based) and it’s semantics (more functional than
OO).</p></li>
<li><p>A beginner friendly system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The language: to use Lobster where it shines, you need to get
very familiar with higher order functions for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Its engine, while friendly for simple drawing, generally gives
you a lot of control (immediate mode rendering), and requires you to
understand the rendering pipeline moreso than simple retained mode
object systems (e.g. Flash). If you create more complex games with it,
be prepared to program your own “scenegraph” on top of Lobster’s low
level drawing primitives.</p></li>
<li><p>It contains no game editor or friendly IDE. Everything is
code.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A language for large scale / team programming. Its type system
favors expressive power over building interfaces. It’s best used for
small to medium sized projects by programmers that know what they’re
doing.</p></li>
<li><p>A language that is all things to all people. While I would claim
that Lobster is a <em>general purpose programming language</em>, it is
strongly biased toward game programming and related fields. With a
different set of built-in functions I am sure it would make a kick-ass
server language, but I don’t feel it is important to serve every
niche.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-lobster-is">What Lobster is:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A language design motivated by <em>refactoring</em> and
<em>compositionality</em>. It should be easier than in most languages to
rip arbitrary pieces of code out and reorganize them and make them
reusable, to keep the program <em>non-redundant</em>. Lobster’s free
variables ensure that your code keeps doing what it did before it was
moved without needing to create tons of function arguments. They allow
your new functionality to be as local as possible, and look just as
terse as any built-in abstractions when using function value arguments.
I am fanatic about well-factored code, so the design reflects my
thinking on how give the programmer maximum refactoring
fluidity.</p></li>
<li><p>A language that has some goodies built-in that streamline code
typical in games, for example almost everything can operate on vectors
of numbers (2D, 3D, 4D).</p></li>
<li><p>A language inspired more by functional programming than by object
oriented programming. Lobster is of course an imperative language first:
games are full of global state, and I believe that the most natural way
to express that is directly, rather than indirectly by emulating state
(such as with monads). That said, any program benefits from trying to
write as much code as possible in a purely functional style, i.e. if it
is easy to express something in terms of re-generating data instead of
modifying it in place, you almost always should. Lobster has some very
strong tools to make this possible, with a very terse and uniform higher
order function call syntax, and optionally immutable objects. Lobster
actually has very powerful object oriented features (its overloading and
dynamic dispatch being more expressive than in most OO languages), but
it doesn’t push it’s OO angle to the forefront, and unlike OO languages
doesn’t have an object heavy API. While OO brought us many important
ideas in programming, it is also single-handedly responsible for the
crippling over-engineering culture so prevalent nowadays, and Lobster is
trying to go the opposite direction.</p></li>
<li><p>A type system that tries to get as close to the experience of
using a dynamically typed language as possible while allowing maximum
efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>A language that tries to be very efficient with memory, thanks to
compile time reference counting, inline structs, and a very fast
allocator.</p></li>
<li><p>The belief that the ideal programming language is… TWO
programming languages. Any larger project consists of a lot of high
level and glue code that is infrequently executed and benefits from the
simple and terse notation of a language like Lobster. However, any non
trivial project (especially in games) also contains a few algorithms
where complete control of memory layout and native code is desirable,
and for that, there really is only one viable language, namely C++.
Having access to both languages in a single project gives the most
options for creating a fast, high quality result in reasonable time.
Importantly, past systems/engines have not realized this potential
because they make C++ the dominant language that is responsible for all
the glue code, thus reducing the utility of the scripting language and
complicating the overal project. Lobster instead wants Lobster code to
be the main program, and relegate C++ to implement small libraries of
speed sensitive code.</p></li>
<li><p>An engine that adheres to <em>make simple things simple, and
complex things possible</em>. It requires very little code to start
drawing, yet the system doesn’t make any assumptions about what kind of
thing you might want to program, and how you want to structure
it.</p></li>
<li><p>A portable, cross platform system, targeting desktop and mobile
OSes alike.</p></li>
<li><p>An implementation that cares about simplicity, speed, and
robustness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-lobster-was-history">What Lobster was (History):</h3>
<p>Lobster development started in October of 2010.</p>
<p>Unlike code, normally a programming language design is so intricate,
you benefit from designing almost all of it up-front, before you write
the first line of code. Lobster wasn’t designed like that, it’s design
was constantly refactored much like it’s implementation. In fact,
normally the first thing I write before I start writing a parser is the
grammar, but Lobster’s grammer was instead derived from the parser code.
Because initially it was simply a platform for fun and experimenation of
language features, it started out very different, both in syntax and
semantics.</p>
<p>Lobster started out fully dynamically scoped. I like the idea of
dynamic scoping, and wanted to experiment with it, to see if all the
people on the net claiming it is evil are a bunch of whiners. I found
out very quickly they are not whiners and reverted to default lexical
scoping.</p>
<p>My other early experiment was a complete implementation of Icon-style
backtracking. For example, you could write things like:</p>
<pre><code>print #3 &lt; 2 | #3 * 2</code></pre>
<p>which would print <code>0 1 0 2 4</code>. In short, whereas in most
programming language an expression returns exactly 1 result, in Icon an
EarlyLobster it would 0..N results. <code>#</code> was an iteration
operator that would generate values much like <code>for</code> does
nowadays, and <code>|</code> would simply concatenate streams of values.
The concept of something being false just meant no values were
generated, i.e. the <code>&lt;</code> operator returns 0 or 1 results
(the lhs). This backtracking would even work across function
definitions.</p>
<p>If that sounds complicated, it is certainly hard to get right, though
it was helped by the fanastic paper <em>The Implementation of Generators
and Goal-Directed-Evaluation in Icon</em> by Janalee O’Bagy whose
implementation technique I followed closely.</p>
<p>Sadly, though examples like the above look super terse and very
powerful, more general examples turned out less readable, less general,
and not much shorter than the equivalent code using higher order
functions, which is when I got inspired to instead focus on making
higher order functions terser and more similar to built-iteration, and
make sure they have the same shortcutting power as backtracking (using
Lobster’s cross-function <code>return</code>). I ripped out all
backtracking code at this point. I still have a copy of the last version
that has this functionality in, which at some point I can release if
there’s interest.</p>
<p>Syntax wise, EarlyLobster had a more haskell-y / smalltalk-y
bracketed syntax. See for example:</p>
<pre><code>factorial: [ n =&gt; 1 &gt; n | (factorial n - 1) * n ]
print &quot;factorial of 7: &quot; + (factorial 7)</code></pre>
<p>Function blocks were <code>[]</code>, and lists were <code>{}</code>.
One of the first changes I made post EarlyLobster was to switch those
two, and make function calls more C-style, as I had to admit I found I
liked that better anyway, and made it easier to have function blocks
follow the function call instead of being inside of it. Then I noticed I
could denote function blocks entirely without brackets and just with
indentation, and those were removed too.</p>
<p>The implementation still had the C-stack based function calling
implied by the abovementioned paper, which now wasn’t necessary anymore,
and Lobster switched to a more traditional VM stack.</p>
<p>Later, multi-methods, and more recently, coroutines, got added.</p>
<p>Most recently, Lobster transitioned from being a dynamically typed
language to a statically typed language. I prefer programming using
dynamic typing, but I had an idea how I could use specialization in
combination with type inference and flow-sensitive typing to get very
far in being able to type-check all existing Lobster code without having
to litter it with types. That challenge took it much further than I
anticipated. The end result is impressively powerful, even though I made
it a bit more strict than I planned (i.e. making <code>nil</code> its
own type). More here: <a href="type_checker.html">type system</a>.</p>
<p>Another big change is moving to compile-time reference counts
(lifetime analysis) and in-line structs, about which you can read more
in <a href="memory_management.html">memory management</a>.</p>
<p>This signals the move of Lobster to a more efficiency/strong typing
oriented language. Strongly typed enums and bools got added, and
multi-methods got replaced by a very flexible overloading / dispatching
system. See the <a href="language_reference.html">language
reference</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2020, co-routines were removed, along with the lesser known
“frame log” feature. A full explanation of why is <a
href="https://github.com/aardappel/lobster/issues/100">here</a> The
summary: it is a feature that seems very attractive for game
programming, but in practice never got used (and in most cases works
just as well with classes), and they put a big complexity strain on the
implementation that makes it harder to make the language faster. The
last version of the language that does contain co-routines is marked
with the label <code>last_coroutine</code> in git, and the diff showing
exactly what was all removed (and thus gives a good picture on how it
used to work) is <a
href="https://github.com/aardappel/lobster/commit/9483b7026419fdce5421d22b2181e77e666daf82">here</a>.
Similarly, the last version that has frame log functionality is
<code>last_frame_log</code> and the diff is <a
href="https://github.com/aardappel/lobster/commit/274f76ca1f36742469090befbdb7d7eaa108af8f">here</a></p>

Plans)</h3>

needs in <code>dev/TODO.txt</code>.</p>
