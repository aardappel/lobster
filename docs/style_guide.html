<h1 class="title">Lobster Style Guide</h1>
</header>
<p>This document defines the style that ideally should be used for all
lobster programs.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-document">Why this document?</h2>
<p>There is no such thing as the provably best style for writing code:
it all comes down to human preference. But one thing is extremely
detrimental to reading code: inconsistent source code formatting. Hence
why it is good to have a fixed style.</p>
<p>You are free to pick any style the compiler will accept for your own
projects, of course. But if you wish to cooperate with other Lobster
programmers, using the style set forth in this document will be helpful.
Most code you will find will use this style, so trying to enforce
another style may be tricky.</p>
<p>Python, being the language closest in syntax to Lobster, has a well
defined <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">style
guide</a>, and so do other languages, like Java. C/C++ in particular has
failed to establish a clear style, which is a constant source of
confusion and disagreement.</p>
<h2 id="default-style">Default Style</h2>
<p>Unless noted explicitly in this document, the style to follow is that
of the samples in the Lobster documentation and distribution. Let’s look
at a typical example:</p>
<pre><code>def qsort(xs, lt):
    if xs.length &lt;= 1:
        xs
    else:
        let pivot = xs[0]
        let tail = xs.slice(1, -1)
        append(append(qsort(tail.filter():     lt(_, pivot), lt), [ pivot ]),
                      qsort(tail.filter(): not lt(_, pivot), lt))</code></pre>
<h3 id="indentation-tabs-vs-spaces">Indentation: Tabs vs Spaces</h3>
<p>By default, you should use 4 spaces to indent (same as Python). The
compiler will allow you to use tabs (discouraged), and in some cases
even a mix (highly discouraged).</p>
<p>The compiler will error on mixed use of tabs and spaces, as that
could change what code appears to mean.</p>
<p>In theory, tabs are superior for editing, but in practice, different
editors and different methods of displaying code can make tab based code
work inconsistently, which is more of a problem for a language with
significant indentation like Lobster and Python.</p>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<p>Typical use of whitespace is around any binary operator (in the
example <code>&lt;=</code> <code>=</code>), after a <code>,</code> and
inside <code>[]</code> when used as vector constructor or definition
(but not when used for indexing, and not inside <code>()</code>).</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>As seen in the <code>append</code> call, you are encouraged to make
similar code line up using extra spaces. Because the first part of the
<code>append</code> call ended in a <code>,</code> the second line is
not counted as an indentation in the same way as the indentation blocks
above it.</p>
<h3 id="identifiers">Identifiers</h3>
<p>Lobster uses lowercase for almost all indentifiers. If an identifier
consists of multiple words, they are preferably just written
consecutively, though for cases where that becomes unreadable using an
<code>_</code> to separate them is ok. Do not uses <code>_</code> to
start or end regular identifiers (see the reference manual about
anonymously declared variables).</p>
<h3 id="indentation-vs-one-liners">Indentation vs one-liners</h3>
<p>Prefer indentation over one liners unless the block is very short,
e.g. <code>if a &lt; 0: 10 else: a - 5</code> is better in-line than
indented. Avoid the use of <code>;</code> generally, if you need
multiple expressions in a block, indentation is superior.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-the-shortest-form">Prefer the shortest form</h3>
<p>Whenever short forms are available for a particular syntax, prefer to
use that, unless readability would suffer.</p>
