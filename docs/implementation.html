<h1 class="title">The Lobster C++ Implementation</h1>
</header>
<p>This document gives hints on how to work with the Lobster C++ code in
terms of building, extending, reusing, and compiling Lobster code to
C++.</p>
<p>Lobster has been released under the Apache 2 open source license.</p>
<h2 id="building-lobster">Building Lobster</h2>
<p>Lobster uses recent C++17 features, so will need Visual Studio 2022
(the free community edition will do), Xcode 10.x, or a recent GCC (9+) /
Clang (9+) to be compiled.</p>
<p>Lobster uses OpenGL, SDL 2.x and FreeType, these are included in the
repo, so should compile out of the box with no further external
dependencies.</p>
<p>All source code and other files related to building Lobster for all
platforms sit in the <code>dev</code> folder.</p>
<p>Lobster should be built for 64-bit platforms where possible. It will
still also build on 32-bit Wasm &amp; Android. This does not affect
Lobster data type sizes, e.g. <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>
types are 64-bit on all platforms.</p>
<p>Lobster can be built with a JIT (on desktop platforms, convenient
during development, as it can run Lobster source “instantly”), or by
compiling to C++ (possible on all platforms, required on non-desktop),
see below.</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>Open up <code>dev\lobster\lobster.sln</code> with Visual Studio, and
ensure <code>Release</code> mode is selected. The project is set up to
build lobster.exe in the <code>bin</code> folder, and will be ready for
use as described either from the <a
href="command_line_usage.html">command line</a> or <a
href="vscode_ide.html">VS Code</a> / <a
href="sublime_ide.html">SublimeText</a> / <a
href="notepadpp_ide.html">Notepad++</a>.</p>
<h3 id="os-x-ios">OS X &amp; iOS</h3>
<p>Building for either one is easy using the single Xcode project (in
<code>dev/xcode/lobster</code>) which produces a .app bundle for either
platform (the <code>lobsterapp</code> and <code>lobster_ios</code>
targets), or a command line version for OS X (the <code>lobster</code>
target) placed in the <code>bin</code> folder much like Windows.</p>
<p>To develop Lobster code on OS X, easiest probably is to use the
command line version. Many OS X editors support running a command line
compiler, e.g. VSCode, SublimeText, or Komodo Edit with Tools -&gt; Run
Command.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could add your lobster source (and extra data it
might need) to the Xcode project, and add it to the build rules such
that these are copied to the Resource location in the bundle, then
running from Xcode with the main lobster file as command line
argument.</p>
<p>Distribution is currently a bit clumsier. You’ll need to run lobster
to produce a pak file (see <a href="command_line_usage.html">command
line</a>), then make a copy of the bundle, and stick the bytecode file
(+data) in the Resource location, and you should have something that can
be distributed to users. For iOS you can compile using the OS X exe,
then run that same pak file using the iOS exe.</p>
<p>For iOS be sure to read how to compile to C++ below.</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>You can build with CMake on Linux:</p>
<p>This requires a C++17 compiler, and the mesa dev files should be
installed (<code>apt-get install mesa-common-dev</code>).</p>
<pre><code>cd dev
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release &amp;&amp; make -j8</code></pre>
<p>It creates <code>bin/lobster</code>. Run it to access the samples,
e.g. <code>bin/lobster samples/pythtree.lobster</code></p>
<p>Note the <code>LOBSTER_ENGINE</code> CMake option, which is by
default on. You can turn this off to get a command-line only version of
Lobster that does not depend on OpenGL, SDL, FreeType etc.</p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the latest <a
href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>
installed, and follow instructions to add the <a
href="https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk.md">NDK</a></p>
<p>In Android Studio, use “Open” to open the
<code>dev/android-project</code> dir. It may complain about not knowing
where the NDK lives, either let it fix this automatically, or manually
modify the path in <code>local.properties</code></p>
<p>Using the desktop lobster exe, build your desired Lobster program
using the <code>--pak</code> option, such that all assets end up in a
single file (see below for more information). Place the result in
<code>dev/android-project/app/src/main/assets/default.lpak</code> so it
will automatically be picked up by the build process and added to the
APK. Also compile your Lobster code to C++ as described below.</p>
<p>You should now be able to just press run. Wait for the build, and see
it launch on an attached Android device. Note that Lobster requires a
device that supports GLES 3.0 and Android version 4.3 (Jellybean).
Emulators often do not support ES3, you’ll see a shader compile error in
logcat if this happens.</p>
<p>If there are errors running, check logcat.</p>
<p>Things to change if you want to release your app in the Google Play
store (these instructions may be out of date):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate your own signing key with <code>keytool</code>. Make
sure to also delete any old debug copy of the app from your device, or
you’ll get a signature mismatch error.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the name to something else in
<code>app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the .png files in <code>app/src/main/res/</code> with your
own application icon.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to change the package name from
<code>org.libsdl.app</code> to your own. This needs to be done in 3
places, <code>app/build.gradle</code>, and
<code>app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app/SDLActivity.java</code> (both at
the top of that file and the directory path itself!). Alternatively
create a new class and inherit from <code>SDLActivity</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="webassembly-emscripten">WebAssembly / Emscripten</h3>
<p>You need the <a
href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html">emscripten
toolchain</a> installed, as well as GNU make (on windows that means
installing <a
href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">this</a>).</p>
<p>Before you build, gather your lobster distribution files (see below)
and place them in <code>dev/emscripten/assets</code>. They will be
automatically picked up by the build process this way.</p>
<p>The Wasm implementation does not support the JIT, so you should first
compile your <code>.lobster</code> code to C++, as described in the
section “Compiling Lobster code to C++” below.</p>
<p>To build, go to <code>dev/emscripten</code>, and type
<code>make -j8</code>. This should produce a lobster.[wasm|js|html|data]
in the same directory (the latter containing whatever you placed in
<code>assets</code>).</p>
<p>You can now run it with
<code>emrun --browser chrome lobster.html --verbose</code> or if that
doesn’t work, <code>emrun --no_browser lobster.html --verbose</code> and
manually navigate to
<code>http://localhost:6931/lobster.html?--verbose</code> in your
browser. Note that just loading up the html in your browser directly may
not work because of security restrictions. Alternatively place all the
generated files on a webserver, and load from there.</p>
<h2 id="distributing-lobster-programs.">Distributing Lobster
programs.</h2>
<p>While the above instructions will build you the lobster executable,
to distribute a Lobster program to others, you will need to distribution
files. These must be (including correct paths):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>default.lpak</code>. This is the Lobster pakfile file you
obtain from compiling your program with the <code>--pak</code> option,
it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The bytecode.</p></li>
<li><p><code>data/shaders/default.materials</code> (these are the
minimum shader definitions needed for to render anything, and is
implicitly loaded by <code>gl_window</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Any other files/directories you have specified with
<code>pakfile</code>, e.g:
<code>gl_load_texture(pakfile ”mypath/myfile.png”)</code>.
<code>pakfile</code> can prefix filenames or directories (ending in
<code>/</code>), in which case all files in the directory will
(non-recursively) be added. When running with <code>--verbose</code> you
can see what files are added/loaded from a pakfile, and which are loaded
individually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Any files your code references that are not in the pakfile (e.g.
<code>gl_load_texture(”mypath/myfile.png”)</code> ).</p></li>
<li><p>On Windows, you’ll need to include
<code>bin\openvr_api.dll</code> and/or <code>bin\steam_api.dll</code>
next to <code>lobster.exe</code> ONLY if you use functions starting with
<code>vr_</code> or <code>steam_</code> respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Where you place these files depends on the platform, on Windows /
Linux it is next to the lobster executable, on OS X / iOS it is the
application bundle under Contents, on Android it’s under assets in the
.apk, and with emscripten there’s an assets directory also.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-lobster-code-to-c">Compiling Lobster code to C++</h2>
<p>Rather than directly executing with a JIT, Lobster can also be
translated to C++, for a further speed boost. This is useful when
releasing a shipping build to customers, but hopefully not necessary
during development. It is necessary for building for mobile/web
platforms.</p>
<p>With the <code>--cpp</code> option on the command-line, the compiler
will generate <code>dev/compiled_lobster/src/compiled_lobster.cpp</code>
(currently, you MUST compile it from the root of the repo,
e.g. <code>bin/lobster --cpp somepath/my.lobster</code>, otherwise this
will likely fail). This file contains a <code>main()</code> and is
otherwise self-contained such that when you compile it with the build
files for any platform (see instructions above) substituting it for the
standard <code>main.cpp</code>, you’ll end up with an executable that
runs only that specific program.</p>
<p>On Windows, there are project files in
<code>dev/compiled_lobster</code> that will automatically pick up the
compiled lobster code.</p>
<p>On Linux, building in <code>dev</code> like above, then instead
<code>cmake -DLOBSTER_TOCPP=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .</code> will
automatically substitute the compiled lobster main program. Build with
<code>make -j8</code> or similar.</p>
<p>For Emscripten, there’s a <code>cpp</code> make target (which is the
default) that works similar to the WebAssembly mode described below.</p>
<h2 id="extending-lobster">Extending Lobster</h2>
<p>Besides using Lobster as a stand-alone programming language as-is,
there are 2 ways of extending Lobster, by adding your code to Lobster,
or adding Lobster to your project.</p>
<p>Note that unlike other scripting languages, Lobster has been designed
as a stand-alone language first, rather than a plug-in scripting system
(more like Python and Ruby, not like Lua and UnrealScript). You use
Lobster code as your “main program”, with the “engine” being the library
you call into. Most game engines are the opposite: the engine code is
the main program, and the scripting language is being called into. For
that reason, adding your own code to Lobster is by the far the
preferable way of building an application that uses Lobster, and will
generally be a much more productive environment.</p>
<p>The thinking here is that you use C++ purely to write performance
critical code, which can usually be contained in libraries. For the
non-performance critical code, which includes the general setup of your
main program determining how things fit together, you are much better
off using a friendlier language, like Lobster. It means that changing
the structure of your project is much quicker, and it is easier to
experiment with new game ideas based on your C++ libraries. Iterations
in Lobster can be done more rapidly and more safely, often in less code,
than C++.</p>
<h3 id="adding-your-code-to-lobster">Adding your code to Lobster</h3>
<p>Depending on what you want to write, the current engine functionality
of Lobster may not be sufficient. Lobster adds C++ functions to the
language in a modular fashion, in the Visual Studio project you can see
all things added to Lobster in 2 places:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “builtins” folder, which should really be part of any Lobster
implementation. <code>buitins.cpp</code> is the most important one that
adds vector &amp; math operations etc., without which the language would
be hard to use. <code>file.cpp</code> adds file I/O related functions,
and <code>lobsterreader.cpp</code> allows you to parse data structures
in lobster syntax from a running program.</p></li>
<li><p>The engine folder. This contains all graphics/font/audio etc
functionality. <code>graphics.cpp</code> / <code>font.cpp</code> build
on top of the above mentioned 3 libraries, and can either be kept, or
replaced entirely by functions that use a different rendering system.
You can turn Lobster into a console-only language in one step by simply
removing the engine folder from the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always run Lobster with the <code>-r</code> option to get an
overview of all functions currently added to the system (the current
list is <a href="builtin_functions_reference.html">here</a>). To
add/remove functionality is generally as easy as adding/removing the
corresponding <code>.cpp</code> file.</p>
<p>Lobster uses some macros to allow you to define a native function in
one location without declarations needed elsewhere. To learn how to
write your own .cpp of native functions, best to start with a simple
example, such as <code>audio.cpp</code>, then browse through more
complex examples in <code>builtin.cpp</code> and
<code>graphics.cpp</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of a Lobster extension:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;lobster/stdafx.h&quot;

#include &quot;lobster/natreg.h&quot;

using namespace lobster;

void MyNativeOps(NativeRegistry &amp;nfr) {

    nfr(&quot;add&quot;, &quot;x,y&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;I&quot;,
        &quot;Adds two integers.&quot;,
        [](StackPtr &amp;, VM &amp;, Value &amp;x, Value &amp;y) {
            return Value(x.ival() + y.ival());
        });

    // more such declarations here
}</code></pre>
<p>You’ll need to become somewhat familiar with the Lobster internals to
write these functions succesfully, in particular with the
<code>Value</code> type (see <code>vmdata.h</code>), which is a union of
all possible lobster types. If you specify specific types (such as
<code>I</code> for <code>int</code>, <code>F</code> for
<code>float</code>, <code>S</code> for <code>string</code>,
<code>V</code> for <code>vector</code> etc (more details in
<code>natreg.h</code>), then the <code>Value</code> will already have
been typechecked and guaranteed to be that type, such that you can
directly access the component (e.g. <code>.ival()</code>) without
checking the type (you’ll get an assert if you get this wrong).</p>
<p>As you can see, even the help text is included in the declaration, so
everything related to the function is in one location.</p>
<p>Important is dealing with memory management: by default, you
<em>borrow</em> all arguments, meaning you’re not supposed to keep a
pointer to them after the function ends. If you return a value that was
allocated (see e.g. <code>VM::NewString</code>) then the caller will own
this value. This is typically what you want. If for whatever reason you
want to hold on to a value, have a look at functions that do so, like
<code>push</code>.</p>
<p>In designing your extension library, if you intend to add a lot of
functions, it is a good idea to choose a namespace (similar to
<code>gl_</code> for all the graphics functionality) to all your
functions. Lobster uses <code>_</code> for namespacing also in the
language. The burden on making sure there are no name clashes is on the
programmer integrating new libraries (you will get an assert if 2 names
ever clash).</p>
<p>Now from your main program, you’ll need to call
<code>RegisterBuiltin(nfr, "name", MyNativeOps)</code> or similar before
you invoke the Lobster compiler, such that these new functions are
available during all compiler passes.</p>
<p>You can add the above file to whatever build system you’re using, but
that may involve modifying the Lobster project files which you may not
want to do. Instead, if your extension is small enough to sit in a
header file, you can make use of the automatic inclusion of
<code>projects/include/lobster_engine_plugins.h</code> (see comments in
<code>engine.cpp</code>) which will then automatically be picked up as
part of any Lobster build.</p>
<h3 id="adding-lobster-to-your-project">Adding Lobster to your
project</h3>
<p>This should still be fairly easy, as Lobster was made to be fairly
modular, but is a bit more work than above. I will strive to make this
path easier in the future.</p>
<p>With the CMake project, this is easy, as all
<code>LOBSTER_ENGINE=OFF</code> will get you a Lobster build without the
built-in engine, the result you can add to your own projects. You’ll
likely want to replace <code>main.cpp</code> with something that runs
Lobster from your own code.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the visual studio project, there is the
<code>language</code> project, which is what you’d want to include in
your own projects, and the <code>engine</code> project which you are
replacing. Finally there’s again <code>main.cpp</code> to adapt.</p>
<p>Some of Lobster relies on it’s own math library
(<code>geom.h</code>), but it should be very easy to make convenient
functions to convert Lobster vectors into your own math types (you could
wrap around the <code>ToValue</code> and <code>ValueTo</code>
functions).</p>
