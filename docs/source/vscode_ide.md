title: VSCode as Lobster IDE
---

Running Lobster programs from within the editor
-----------------------------------------------

-   Copy `docs/vscode/tasks.json` to a `.vscode` workspace folder that
    is in the root of where you keep your lobster code.

-   Load some lobster code. pressing `ctrl+shift+b` should run it. If there was
    an error, press `F8` to go to it, and/or `` ctrl+` `` (shell) to show
    program output.

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

Copy the folder `docs/vscode/lobster` to `.vscode/extensions` *within
your user folder*, not your workspace folder. This will enable syntax
highlighting next time VSCode is run.
