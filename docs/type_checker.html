<h1 class="title">The Lobster Type System</h1>
</header>
<p>This document is about how to make most effective use of the type
system..</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-the-type-system">The nature of the type
system</h2>
<p>Lobster was originally dynamically typed. Not only is this easier to
implement, it bring tremendous expressive power “for free”, particularly
in the way it allows you to write generic code which often requires
arcane typing annotations in static languages. The downsides are obvious
too: type errors come late or stay hidden, and execution speed
suffers.</p>
<p>The type system in Lobster attempts to achieve the best of both
worlds, with a type system that retains as much as possible of the
dynamic style of writing (little to no type annotations needed, while
able to type check a much broader range of code than other languages).
It achieves this by using 3 techniques that build on eachother:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Type Inference</strong>. A well known technique by now,
as many language employ it one way or another, and it is an obvious way
to reduce type annotations. By itself it is rather restrictive however,
as it is limited in the kind of generic code it can correctly
type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specialization</strong>. Instead of struggling to infer
or define generic types for everything, we specialize functions to the
exact parameter types they are called with. This allows a much wider
range of possible code inside generic functions, since they are only
ever type-checked with specific types. This of course requires there to
be multiple copies of functions, but in practice the code expansion is
minimal. Specialized code can be optimized and inlined more
aggressively, resulting in significant speed advantages besides the
expressivity gains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flow Based</strong>: Type checking happens in order of
function calls, i.e. it is much like evaluating the code, but with types
instead of values. This means that when type checking a particular
function, it not just knows the exact types of parameters (thanks to
specialization), but also the types of free variables, and it knows its
callers (a compile time call stack). This means that when a type error
happens, you can see in what context the wrong type got created and
passed down. Think of it as an earlier dynamic type error. In addition,
it takes into account the state of conditional statements, allowing you
to avoid unnecessary type errors.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, you are less constrained in the kind kind of code you
can write that still type checks correctly, while using less
annotations. But with great power comes great responsibility: the less
annotations you write, the more a compile time error indeed looks like a
run-time error: they are almost as hard to track down. It is certainly
easy to start with no annotations, and then gradually add them in places
to force type errors to come earlier and be easier to understand. Find
your own trade-off.</p>
<h2 id="writing-generic-code">Writing generic code</h2>
<p>In the simplest cases, there is no difference between writing
dynamically typed code and typed code. For example a simple function
like:</p>
<pre><code>def add(x, y): x + y</code></pre>
<p>is how you create a generic functions in either case. You create a
generic parameter by.. not specifying a type!</p>
<p>Now this is already a non-trivial example that will trip up many
languages with type inference, since you cannot have the arguments be
generic unless the <code>+</code> operation is defined on them,
requiring them to have a way to specify the set of types that have this
operation specified (see e.g. type classes in Haskell), or simply not
allowing it at all (see e.g. generics in Java).</p>
<p>Lobster does not have this problem, since it simply type checks a
copy of <code>add</code> for each combination of types it is called
with. This then deals correctly with allowing to write
<code>add("number: ", 4)</code>, taking care of converting
<code>4</code> to a string and calling string concatenation on the
result, without making simpler cases like <code>add(1, 2)</code> slower
because of type inspection. In fact, the opportunities for statically
optimizing these operations are now greatly increased. This is very
similar to C++ templates, but without the clunky syntax.</p>
<p>It is typically “good style” in Lobster to use untyped arguments when
a) multiple types are possible/useful, and b) there is no relation
between the types of the arguments. Sometimes it is useful to use
explicit generic annotations, for example:</p>
<pre><code>def add&lt;T&gt;(x:T, y:T): x + y</code></pre>
<p>Would enforce that both parameters are of the same type, unlike the
example above. The type <code>T</code> is automatically deduced from the
first argument that matches it (in this case, the first), and then any
further uses are required to be that same type, so for example
<code>add(1.0, 1)</code> would make <code>T</code> a <code>float</code>,
and thus coerce the second argument to <code>float</code> before the
function call. In the untyped case above, it would specialize
<code>add</code> for <code>(float, int)</code> arguments, and the
coercion to <code>float</code> (required by <code>+</code>) would now
happen inside the function.</p>
<p>You can even specify the generic type explicitly, for example
<code>add&lt;float&gt;(1, 1)</code> would actually coerce both arguments
ahead of time. If the function has multiple generic arguments, you don’t
need to specify all of them, if the remaining ones can be inferred.
Caveat: this currently only works where the <code>&lt;</code> directly
follows a known function name (to distinguish it from uses of the
<code>&lt;</code> operator).</p>
<p>And all of this also works on untyped function declarations equally,
since they internally get converted to explicit generics by simply
adding generic types <code>A, B, C,..</code> to them for their untypes
arguments.</p>
<p>You can use generic types from surrounding functions, and from any
class this function is a “method” of (either declared inside that class,
or with the class type as first argument).</p>
<h2 id="the-trouble-with-nil">The trouble with nil</h2>
<p>So far, the type system tries to preserve as much freedom of dynamic
typing as possible. One area where it is however <em>more</em> strict
than most existing languages is how it deals with <code>nil</code>.</p>
<p><code>nil</code> (or <code>null</code> in other languages) is usually
a default value of all reference types, which is very convenient in
expressing uninitialized or optional values. But this convenience comes
at a high cost: if you forget to check for <code>nil</code> before you
access a value, your program may terminate with a run-time error. Very
often we know a value cannot be <code>nil</code>, but we cannot
guarantee this, or are lazy to do so. Result: random errors popping up
in random places. Not good.</p>
<p>Lobster takes the obvious approach: <code>nil</code> is a separate
type that is <em>not a valid value</em> of a reference type. You may
still create “nilable” types, but these cannot be accessed
(e.g. dereferenced) unless they are first converted to their underlying
type:</p>
<pre><code>var a = nil      // a is a nilable of unknown type
if ..:
    a = &quot;foo&quot; // a is a nilable string
a += &quot;bar&quot;    // error: + not defined for nil
if a:         // guaranteed not be nil inside block
    a += &quot;!&quot;  // ok: a is of type string here</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can use conditionals to guard code that wants to
access a nilable. This seems like a hassle maybe, but think of the
benefit: you will never see a <code>nil</code> related run-time error
<em>ever again</em>.</p>
<p>And now that <code>nil</code> is a separate type, we can improve our
code by not using <code>nil</code> unless absolutely necessary. Many
uses of <code>nil</code> in legacy code are lazy, and can be
avoided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If at all possible, try to reorder code such that variables can
be initialized to a valid value right where they are defined. This is
often possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If the variable cannot be initialized where it must be defined,
see if there’s a “empty” version of the reference type that the variable
can be initialized with, such as an empty vector or string, or a class
filled with zeroes, that has a benign effect when used.</p></li>
<li><p>If you must start with <code>nil</code>, try to have the if-check
for it as early on as possible, so all code deeper down the call chain
can benefit from a non-nil type that doesn’t need to be
checked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The flow based analysis generally understand logical expressions, so
if you write <code>if not a:</code> instead, you’ll be able to access
<code>a</code> in the <code>else</code> block, but not in the
<code>then</code> block. Similarly, if you write
<code>if a and f(a):</code> then <code>a</code> is available as non-nil
both as argument to <code>f</code> <em>and</em> in the following
block.</p>
<p><code>?</code> is generally the way to indicate a nilable type,
e.g. <code>string?</code> is a nilable string.</p>
<p>One more thing to notice about <code>nil</code> is that it only knows
what exact nilable type it represents once it comes “in contact with”
its reference type. That means that if you tried to access
<code>a</code> right after it was defined, it would have still have type
<code>nil</code> rather than <code>string?</code>. Similarly, if you
tried to assign a vector to <code>a</code> after the first assignment,
it would complain that only a <code>string?</code> is valid, i.e. a
<code>string</code> or <code>nil</code> value.</p>
<p>To bypass that process and force <code>nil</code> to represent a
particular nilable type, you can attach a type, like
<code>nil:string</code>, which creates a value of type
<code>string?</code>. Alternatively you could write
<code>nil and a</code>, which makes <code>nil</code> have the type of
whatever <code>a</code> has, which may be a generic variable. Similarly,
<code>a or nil</code> has the same nilable type, but now the value is
actually <code>a</code> rather than <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h2 id="more-flow-based-types">More flow based types</h2>
<p>As we saw with <code>nil</code>, a variable may have a different type
in certain parts of the code, thanks to the information that a
conditional provides.</p>
<p>Another example of this is the <code>is</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>if a is xyz: a.x</code></pre>
<p>We can access fields of <code>xyz</code> regardless of what type
<code>a</code> had outside this scope. <code>is</code> is only true if
the types are exactly equal, not subtypes.</p>
<p>Assignment can work similar to conditionals:</p>
<pre><code>var a = nil
if ..: a = xyz_0
a.x        // error
a = xyz_0  // a is guaranteed non-nil below
a.x        // ok</code></pre>
<p>Note how there are two different cases here: with an assignment
inside a conditional, the type checker has to be conservative, and can’t
guarantee the value is non-nil. But with an un-conditional assignment,
we can change the type of <code>a</code> for the rest of the block.</p>
<p>An additional way is to use <code>assert</code>. Use this when you
know for sure a value must be non-nil or have a particular type, but you
can’t structure your code such that this is already obvious to the type
system.</p>
<h2 id="compile-time-if-thens.">Compile-time if-then’s.</h2>
<p>The flow-based type-checking above gives branches more specific
types. But we can do even better: if the condition is statically known,
we can avoid type-checking alltogether:</p>
<pre><code>def compile_time_if(x):
    if x is int or x is float:
        1 / x
    else:
        x
assert(compile_time_if(1) is int)
assert(compile_time_if(&quot;&quot;) is string)</code></pre>
<p>The division would be a type error if x is a string, but it compiles
anyway since this if is compile-time constant, and the type checker
ignores this branch.</p>
<p>If you’re used to dynamic languages, you might think: what’s the
fuss? This would be a compile error in almost all statically typed
languages, since they don’t cull code before the optimizer. For example
with C++ templates can’t handle this situation, and that’s already more
powerful than most forms of generics.</p>
<p>Also note the return type is just the else branch in the string case,
it doesn’t need to make a type union between the branches anymore.</p>
<p>This is powerful, because it allows you to write generic functions
that do subtly different things depending on the input, with no overhead
from the conditional, and the ability to operate differently on each
case.</p>
<p>You can do something similar with overloading / dynamic dispatch, but
that may require more code or may be less efficient.</p>
<h2 id="generic-classes-and-structs">Generic classes and structs</h2>
<p>Besides functions, classes can also be generic, but here we only use
explicit generic parameters to do so:</p>
<pre><code>class foo&lt;T&gt;:
    a:string
    b:T</code></pre>
<p>You can now create named specializations using this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>class foo_f = foo&lt;float&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can now construct a foo with floats, either explicitly with
<code>foo_f { "hi", 2.0 }</code>, or you can use the generic type:
<code>foo { "hi", 2.0 }</code> and let the compiler pick from all
available named specializations. If you wish, you can also construct a
specialization directly without naming it:
<code>foo&lt;float&gt; { "hi", 2.0 }</code></p>
<p>Functions written to accept <code>foo</code> arguments will of course
work on any of the specializations.</p>
<p>You can even specialize and subclass at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>class bar : foo&lt;float&gt;
    c:int

class bar&lt;T, U&gt; : foo&lt;T&gt;
    c:U</code></pre>
<p>The first specializes and subclasses at the same time, creating a
non-generic type. the second version subclasses <code>foo</code> into
another generic type, passing on one generic parameter and introducing
another.</p>
<h2 id="numeric-structs-math-vector-types">Numeric Structs (math vector
types)</h2>
<p>Structs whose fields are either all int or all float have a special
status in the type system, as they are accepted as arguments to vector
versions of the built-in operators (<code>+ - * /</code> etc) as well as
many vector operations part of the built-in functions
(e.g. <code>normalize</code>).</p>
<p>You can see the default types for these (<code>xy</code>,
<code>xyz</code>, and <code>xyzw</code>) defined in
<code>modules/stdtype.lobster</code>. Other types also work with these
operations, though (e.g. <code>color</code>).</p>
<p>Confusingly, in math, such N dimensional things are commonly referred
to as “vectors”, whereas Lobster calls its resizable arrays “vectors”.
So in Lobster these things are “numeric structs”, but on occasion may
still also be called “vectors”, sorry for the confusion.</p>
