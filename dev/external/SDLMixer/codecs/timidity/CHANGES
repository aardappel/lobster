This version of TiMidity should contain all the fixes from the
September 25 2003 SDL_mixer CVS snapshot. In addition, I've made some
changes of my own, e.g.:

* All file access is done through SDL_RWops. This means the MIDI
  stream no longer has to be a file. (The config file and instruments
  still have to be though.)

* Replacing of TiMidity's endian-handling with SDL's.

* Removal of much unused or unnecessary code, such as

  + The "hooks" for putting a user interface onto TiMidity.
  + The antialias filter. It wasn't active, and even at 4 kHz I
    couldn't hear any difference when activating it.
  + Removed all traces of LOOKUP_HACK and LOOKUP_INTERPOLATION.
    According to the code comments they weren't very good anyway.
    ("degrades sound quality noticeably"). I also removed the
    disclaimer about the "8-bit uLaw to 16-bit PCM and the 13-bit-PCM
    to 8-bit uLaw tables" disclaimer, since I believe those were the
    tables I removed.
  + Removed LOOKUP_SINE since it was already commented out. I think we
    can count on our target audience having math co-processors
    nowadays.
  + Removed USE_LDEXP since it wasn't being used and "it doesn't make
    much of a difference either way".
  + Removed decompress hack from open_file() since it didn't look very
    portable.
  + Removed heaps of unnecessary constants.
  + Removed unused functions.
  + Assume that LINEAR_INTERPOLATION is always used, so remove all
    code dealing with it not being so. It's not that I think the
    difference in audio quality is that great, but since it wouldn't
    compile without code changes I assume no one's used it for quite
    some time...
  + Assume PRECALC_LOOPS is always defined. Judging by the comments it
    may not make much of a difference either way, so why maintain two
    versions of the same code?

* Moving several static globals into the MidiSong struct. This
  includes sample rate, formate, etc. which are now all per-song.

* Moved some typedefs (e.g. MidiSong) to timidity.h for easy inclusion
  into the MIDI decoder.

* Added free_pathlist().

* Replaced TiMidity's own 8, 16 and 32-bit types with SDL's.

* Made TiMidity look for its configuration file in both /etc and
  /usr/local/lib/timidity. (Windows version remains unchanged.)

* Timidity_PlaySome() now takes three arguments. A MidiSong, a decode
  buffer and decode buffer size in bytes. (MidiSong is a new argument,
  and buffer size used to be in samples.)

  In addition, it will return the number of bytes decoded.

* Added Timidity_Exit().

* Removed Timidity_Stop() and Timidity_Active(). Stopping playback
  should be handled by SDL_sound, and Timidity_PlaySome() will return
  0 when the MIDI stream is finished.

* Modified the ToneBank stuff to allow some data to be shared between
  MidiSongs.

* The following files have been removed: controls.c, controls.h,
  filter.c, filter.h, sdl_a.c, sdl_c.c

* config.h has been renamed as options.h to avoid confusion with the
  automatically generated config.h for SDL_sound.

* Added support for loading DLS format instruments:
	Timidity_LoadDLS(), Timidity_FreeDLS(), Timidity_LoadDLSSong()

* Added Timidity_Init_NoConfig()
