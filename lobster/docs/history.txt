(not updated anymore, future development will be on github only).

2013-05-26:
- added support for accessing local variables inside coroutine objects (see @ operator)
- font rendering now supports utf8 strings and any unicode characters, and efficiently (renders to bitmap only characters actually used)
- improved type annotation abilities:
  * now additionally supports vector / function / coroutine / nil as type annotations
  * can now declare types for struct/value fields that will be checked upon construction
  * can now use other types for vectors, for example, [ a, b, c ]:int guarantees all elements are ints upon construction
- made adding builtin functions more modular.
- added gl_windowtitle, gl_meshsize
- fixed removeobj not comparing string contents
