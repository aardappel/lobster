Learning the language
---------------------

If you already know how to program in at least one C-style language
(C/C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/PHP etc), then a way to get a quick idea of where
Lobster is different is by looking at the [C-style language Cheat Sheet][7].

Useful for reference: [all builtin functions][4] (this part of the documentation
is auto-generated by the compiler).

To learn the language more in-depth: The [language reference][5]. Check out the
[style guide][10] before you write lots of code :)
