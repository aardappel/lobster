<h1 class="title">Learn Lobster: Let’s create a 2D shooter!</h1>
</header>
<p>Let’s walk through all the steps required to make a simple game in Lobster by making a shooter in the same vein as “Geometry Wars”: enemies come at you from all directions, and you have to keep shooting them until you invariably.. die. Sound like fun?</p>
<p>You can follow along just looking at the code and screenshots below, or by loading up <code>samples/shooter_tutorial/tut*.lobster</code> and trying them out yourself.</p>
<p>Decent experience in at least one other programming language required. Minor familiarity with Lobster is required (this tutorial won’t explain all the basics, and focuses mostly on the graphics aspect). No need to know how games work, though minor math knowledge may help.</p>
<h3 id="graphics-setup">1: Graphics Setup</h3>
<p>Let’s start by creating a blank canvas for us to draw on. Something like this:</p>
<p><img src="screenshots/shooter/tut1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Impressively.. empty.</p>
<pre><code>include vec
include color

fatal(gl_window(&quot;Shooter Tutorial&quot;, 640, 480))

while gl_frame() and gl_button(&quot;escape&quot;) != 1:
    gl_clear(color_black)</code></pre>
<p><code>gl_window</code> is our graphics initialization routine, and is the first thing we need to do before we can access any other graphics functionality. We specify a title and a size, though note that these are merely suggestions: on desktop platforms the user may resize/maximize our window, and on mobile platforms they just determine landscape vs portrait orientation, whereas the resolution is determined by the device itself.</p>
<p><code>gl_window</code> returns an error string if something goes wrong (and things can go wrong, behind the scenes this call boots up an OpenGL engine including compiling shaders and what not), and <code>fatal</code> is a utility function defined in <code>std.lobster</code> that we’re including that will quit the program and show the error string if available.</p>
<p>Once we’re up and running, this while loop is our <em>frame loop</em>. Games work by rendering the current state of the game repeatedly to the screen, preferrably fast (30-60 times per second), giving the impression of smooth animation. <code>gl_frame</code> is the core of all of this: it makes sure we advance to rendering the next frame, and checks for input etc. If the user clicks the close button or otherwise terminates the app, <code>gl_frame</code> will return <code>false</code>, which is our signal to quit the game. Additionally, we want the user to be able to quit if they press the escape key, so we check for that too.</p>
<p>Then inside the frame loop, we clear the screen (remember that we draw repeatedly), and then we’re ready to draw. <code>color_black</code> is a constant from <code>color.lobster</code>, representing a 4 component RGBA.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-and-world-space">2: Drawing and World Space</h3>
<p>So now we can start drawing, right? Well, we also have to determine where and how we want to draw:</p>
<p><img src="screenshots/shooter/tut2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Look at that! This is starting to look impressive! Check out those polygons!</p>
<pre><code>include std
include vec
include color

fatal(gl_window(&quot;Shooter Tutorial&quot;, 640, 480))

let worldsize = 20.0

while gl_frame() and gl_button(&quot;escape&quot;) != 1:
    gl_clear(color_black)
    gl_color(color_white)
    gl_translate(float(gl_window_size()) / 2.0)
    gl_scale(gl_window_size().y / worldsize)
    gl_circle(1, 6)</code></pre>
<p>Before we can actually draw, we have to talk about coordinate systems. By default, coordinates in Lobster correspond directly to pixels, with (0,0) in the upper left corner (a left-handed coordinate system), and the total number of pixels depending on the device (or the user), which during any frame is given by <code>gl_window_size</code>. While working directly with pixel sizes may be useful for some applications, generally, we want games to be scalable, meaning they should roughly look the same irrespective of what device they run on.</p>
<p>There is no universal way to do this for games however, because besides different resolutions, you have the more problematic issue of different aspect ratios, varying from 4:3 on the iPad (relatively square) to 3:2, 16:10 and 16:9 (longitudinal) on most desktops and other mobile devices. Your game should ideally look good on that whole range. If you only aim for one ratio, you’ll get borders or things cut off on the other ratios. What works best depends on your game content.</p>
<p>Here we’ll take a simple approach: make the middle of the screen our coordinate system origin, and rendering outward enough from there that we have all ratios covered.</p>
<p>gl_translate changes our coordinate system, and is used throughout graphics rendering in Lobster to render things at different portions of the screen. Here we move from upper-left to the middle of the screen by translating by half the <code>gl_window_size</code>.</p>
<p>Then we have to determine how much of the game world we want to show. We don’t want that related to pixels either, as we don’t want people with smaller screens see less of the game. The computer doesn’t care about real world sizes like feet or meters, so we can make up whatever number we want. It is useful however to pick a number, since that means if we later want to show more or less of the gameworld, we just have to change one number. Here we say we want the screen to be able to fit at least 20 units, and we make this relative to the y resolution of the screen (we’re assuming that’ll be the smaller one of the two).</p>
<p>Now we can finally draw! Let’s put down a temporary graphic for the player. <code>gl_circle</code> draws circles around the current origin, with the first argument being the radius (see how we’re using the world scale for this?), and the second argument is the number of sides. Setting this to something low like 6 actually gets us a hexagon rather than a circle.</p>
<p>Pfew, that’s a lot of talk just for a circle, but we’re getting somewhere. Next up, let’s move our player around. Because games are supposed to be… <em>interactive</em></p>

let worldsize = 20.0
var playerpos = xy_0
let playerspeed = 10

    gl_clear(color_black)
    gl_color(color_white)

    let dir = xy_f { (gl_button(&quot;d&quot;) &gt;= 1) - (gl_button(&quot;a&quot;) &gt;= 1),
                  (gl_button(&quot;s&quot;) &gt;= 1) - (gl_button(&quot;w&quot;) &gt;= 1) }
    let newpos = playerpos + normalize(dir) * gl_delta_time() * playerspeed
    if !any(abs(newpos) &gt; float(gl_window_size()) / scale / 2):
        playerpos = newpos

    gl_translate(playerpos):
        gl_circle(1, 6)</code></pre>
<p>To make our player move, we added 2 new variables: <code>playerpos</code> and <code>playerspeed</code>. We initialize the former with a vector constant from <code>vec.lobster</code>: <code>vec_0</code> means all zeroes.</p>
<p>We first figure out which direction the player wants to move by checking the current state of the WASD keys: by combining the boolean values (0 / 1) for each direction, both DA and SW give us a -1 / 0 / 1 value which conveniently corresponds to a directional vector (<code>dir</code>).</p>
<p>Now, we can’t just add this vector to the player and be done with it, we have to take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the player tries to move in both x and y directions at once, the magnitude of the <code>dir</code> vector is sqrt(2) instead of 1, and thus the player would move faster! We want him to move in all directions at equal speed. <code>normalize</code> ensure we have a vector of length 1. You wouldn’t believe how many games have this bug in it!</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how the code inside the while loop is our frame? Well, depending on the device, we have no idea how many frames per second we’re actually running at. If we simply move a fixed amount each frame, we’ll end up moving faster on faster computers! Yet another common bug that we’ll avoid by multiplying our vector by <code>gl_delta_time</code>, which is the number of seconds (usually a fraction of a second, e.g. 0.033 at 30 FPS) that has passed since the last frame we rendered. The result is that we’ll now move 1 unit (the length of the vector) per second exactly, regardless of how fast or slow our machine is rendering.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, “1 unit per second” may well be too slow for our intended game, so we factor in our own player speed. We can tweak it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Last, but not least, once the player can move, we have to worry about him staying within the game world. What we have to do, is a very simple form of <em>collision detection</em>. Collision detection can be very difficult to program, but here we start by just checking the boundaries of the screen. Note that I put our new position in a separate variable, this is such that we will only make it the new player position if we’re still inside the world. I also created a variable for the scale we set, so that we can use it to know where the screen boundaries are. We first take the absolute value of our new position (so we only have to check one quadrant of the world). Notice how pretty much everything in Lobster works on vectors? This makes it easy to write game code without repeating your code for x and y all over the place. We compute the size of a quadrant, and compare. <code>&lt;</code> here gives us a vector of booleans, to check if any coordinates (x or y) were out of bounds, we use <code>any</code>. If this succeeds, we only then actually move the player. pfew!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have computed a new position, we have to make sure it has an effect. We do this by translating our player position from the middle to where we want to now draw our hexagon. Note something special about this <code>gl_translate</code>: it has a block of code following it (notice the <code>:</code>) much like <code>if</code> or <code>for</code>. <code>gl_translate</code> here actually works like a control structure: it first translates, then executes the body, then resets the translation. This is because what we want to render afterwards (enemies perhaps) should not be rendered relative to the player, but relative to what we had before the player (the world origin). If that sounds confusing, it may become clearer later with more code. Stacking all these transformations is one of the more confusing things about games programming, but it is also rather powerful once you get the hang of it.</p>

    gl_translate playerpos:
        gl_rotate_z tomouse:
            gl_polygon([ xy { -0.5, 0.5 }, xy_x, xy { -0.5, -0.5 } ])</code></pre>
<p>To be able to shoot, first we have to worry about giving our player an orientation. We compute that in the vector <code>tomouse</code> which we get by subtracting the player position from the mouse position (what we want to shoot towards). Something funny is going on here though, as the name <code>gl_local_mouse_pos</code> may indicate: normally mouse positions are in pixels, but those we can’t compare against the player position, which is in world coordinates! <code>gl_local_mouse_pos</code> however gives us the mouse position relative to the current transform, which is world coordinates (as specified by the <code>gl_translate</code> and <code>gl_scale</code> above). We then normalize this vector to make it easier to use, as we don’t care about the original length of this vector.</p>
<p>To make the players orientation visual, we first render the player differently: rather than a simple circle, we render him as a pointy triangle, to make it clear what direction he’s looking at. That’s the <code>gl_polygon</code> at the end with 3 explicit coordinates (relative to the playerpos, which has now become our coordinate system origin thanks to <code>gl_translate</code>). Additionally, we insert a <code>gl_rotate_z</code> command to make the pointy part of the triangle always look towards the mouse cursor. The <code>z</code> is because if we rotate around the z axis, we end up rotating the xy plane, which is what we look at in 2D. The argument to <code>gl_rotate_z</code> can either be a vector (as used here) or an angle in degrees. Vectors are generally awesomer.</p>
<p>Additionally, to cater for situations where the mouse cursor isn’t visible (which it typically isn’t in games) we draw a circle (for now) at the mouse location to give the player feedback where he’s aiming at. This starts at the <code>gl_translate</code> before where we draw the player (before, because if the two overlap, the last one will be drawn on top). We translate to the mouse location in world space, change the linemode to 1 (which draws just the outline instead of a filled circle) and change the color. As you can see, all these commands are ones that undo themselves automatically after the circle is drawn, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Now let’s start firing bullets. To keep things simple for now, we fire them automatically, but firing them using a button would be very easy to add (try it!). We add some constants up top, a firerate (second to fire the next bullet) and their speed of travel in the world. To keep track of what’s going on, we just need a list of bullets, and track when the last bullet was fired.</p>
<p>We define what a bullet is by defining a new struct type, saying that it just has a current position and direction.</p>
<p>Now look at the <code>if</code> inside the code: we check if time has progressed beyond the point the last bullet was supposed to be fired, and if so, we add a new bullet to the list of bullets, making it start at the current player position, travelling in the direction of the mouse. We also increase the <code>lastbullet</code> variable to cause the next one to be fired in 0.1 seconds.</p>
<p>A sidenote on how we’re implementing bullets here: there’s a couple of things not ideal about this, which we do all to keep the example simple and to really build a game from the ground up. First, the way the checking for time is implemented here is a bit fragile, as big time fluctuations may cause bullets to be shot at irregular intervals. Second, this checking for time across frames is better done with <em>coroutines</em>, but that would complicate this tutorial.</p>
<p>Now that we have a list of bullets being generated, we have to update them and draw them. The first line in our <code>for</code> loop updates them, in a manner that should look familiar by now: we move the position along the direction, scaled by the amount of time that has passed this frame and their general speed in world units per second.</p>
<p>Now they’re moving, we can draw them at their current position. We make them yellow, and 0.2 units in radius.</p>
<p>One last thing to before we’re done: our list of bullets will grow indefinitely, and eventually make the game run to a crawl, even though most have moved off screen. We’ll cull bullets that have moved far enough away from the origin that they’re not visible anymore. We’ll do this functional style: <code>filter</code> will give us a new list of bullets for which the magnitude of the position (which is the same as a vector from the origin, which is the middle of the screen) is within twice the world size. We could cull them more precisely than this, but for now, this will have the desired effect of keeping the list small.</p>
<p>Wow, there’s a lot to understand to make even a simple game. But the good news is that in many games you will see the patterns of what we’re doing here again and again, so it is rather useful to get familiar with. It even translates to 3D.</p>
<p>But for now… target practice!</p>
<h3 id="enemies">5: Enemies</h3>
<p><img src="screenshots/shooter/tut5.jpg" /></p>
<p>Since the code is getting long, let’s continue, talking purely in terms of modifications to the existing code:</p>
<pre><code>def renderpointytriangle(pos, dir):
    gl_translate pos:
        gl_rotate_z dir:
            gl_polygon([ xy { -0.5, 0.5 }, xy_x, xy { -0.5, -0.5 } ])</code></pre>
<p>First, let’s take the code for rendering the player and put it in it’s own function, since we’ll be needing it for enemies too. Call instead of the original code with <code>renderpointytriangle(playerpos, tomouse)</code></p>
<pre><code>class enemy { pos:xy_f, hp:int }

var enemyrate = 1.0
let enemyspeed = 3
let enemymaxhp = 5
var enemies = []
var lastenemy = gl_time()</code></pre>
<p>We can set up enemies analogous to bullets. Of course, we could share some of this functionality between them, but let’s not complicate matters for now. Add this to the declarations.</p>
<pre><code>    if lastenemy &lt; gl_time():
        enemies.push(enemy { sincos(rnd(360)) * worldsize * 2, enemymaxhp })
        lastenemy += enemyrate
        enemyrate *= 0.999

    for(enemies) e:
        let playerdir = normalize(playerpos - e.pos)
        e.pos += playerdir * gl_delta_time() * enemyspeed
        for(bullets) b:
            if magnitude(b.pos - e.pos) &lt; 1:
                e.hp = max(e.hp - 1, 0)
                b.pos = xy_x * worldsize * 10
        gl_color lerp(color_red, color_blue, div(e.hp, enemymaxhp)):
            renderpointytriangle(e.pos, playerdir)

    enemies = filter enemies: _.hp</code></pre>
<p>During the frame, we use the above code to deal with enemies, which is very similar to bullets yet again. We spawn new enemies initially once per second. To compute a spawn location, take a random angle, convert to a vector, then offset that vector to somewhere outside the screen to have them flock in from all directions.</p>
<p>We do one special thing: we keep reducing the enemy rate subtly. This guarantees the game will get harder and harder and the player will guaranteed die eventually, it is just a matter of when.</p>
<p>Then we loop through all enemies, compute a vector towards the player, and move the enemy towards him. Of course, now we need to do collision detection between bullets and enemies, which we do in brute force manner by checking every bullet with every enemy. If the quantity of both stays low, this is ok, but for large amounts of objects this approach will eventually get too slow, requiring bucketing of objects in a grid. For now, this is ok. We check the distance between the center of the bullet and the center of the enemy, and consider it a hit if they are a generous 1 unit apart or less. Of course, we could check exact collision with the triangle, but besides being complicated, it might not even be desirable for gameplay.</p>
<p>If we have a hit, we reduce the HP of the enemy by one (we’re using <code>max</code> to ensure it doesn’t go below 0, you’ll see why in a bit). We also need to “kill” the bullet when that happens, but since we already have code that removes bullets that leave the world, we are lazy and make use of that, by moving the bullet far from the center.</p>
<p>Then we render the enemy conveniently with our existing function. We do something fun here, letting the health of the enemy determine its color, from healthy blue to a dead red. We use <code>lerp</code> (linearly interpolate) of 2 colors. <code>div</code> is a useful function that does the same as <code>/</code> on 2 integers but gives a float result.</p>
<p>Then of course we need to cull dead enemies, which we do with a similar <code>filter</code> function. Culling all at once like we do here with bullets and enemies is nice, because culling during update can introduce subtle bugs.</p>
<p>We can’t really play yet however, since we can’t die…</p>
<h3 id="score-and-game-over">6: Score, and Game Over</h3>
<p><img src="screenshots/shooter/tut6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now we have some loose ends to wrap up to call this thing a “game”: we have to keep track of the player health and score (and highscore), and give him a start / game over screen in-between sessions.</p>
<p>To do that, we will have to be able to render text. First step towards doing that is loading up a font, right after <code>gl_window</code>:</p>
<pre><code>check(gl_set_font_name(&quot;data/fonts/US101/US101.TTF&quot;) and gl_set_font_size(32), &quot;can\&#39;t load font!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><code>check</code> is another useful function much like fatal, that ensures the first argument is true, and if not, exits the program with the given message.</p>
<p>To implement the functionality, we start with some new variables:</p>
<pre><code>var playerhealth = 0.0
var score = 0
var highscore = 0
var playing = false</code></pre>
<p>inside our frame, we then test our <code>playing</code> variable, and when true, run the game code we were running before, and if false, display the in-between screen, which simply says:</p>
<pre><code>        let msg = &quot;press space to play!&quot;
        gl_translate float(gl_window_size() - gl_text_size(msg)) / 2:
            gl_text(msg)
        if gl_button(&quot;space&quot;) == 1:
            score = 0
            playerhealth = 100.0
            playerpos = xy_0
            bullets = []
            lastbullet = gl_time()
            enemyrate = 1.0
            enemies = []
            lastenemy = gl_time()
            playing = true</code></pre>
<p>The <code>gl_translate</code> centers our text using the handy <code>gl_text_size</code> which tell us the size of a string in pixels before we’ve even rendered it. <code>gl_text</code> then draws it. We then reset the game state when the game starts, and next frame the game will be playing.</p>
<p>To show the current state to the player, we use the simple:</p>
<pre><code>    gl_text(&quot;health: &quot; + ceiling(playerhealth) + &quot; - score: &quot; + score + &quot; - highscore: &quot; + highscore)</code></pre>
<p>We call this as the very last thing in the frame, so it is visible regardless of wether the player is in-game or not, for simplicity. <code>ceiling</code> is useful since we’ll be calculating the player’s health in float, but want to show only the whole numbers. <code>ceiling</code> here is better than <code>truncate</code>, since we only want to show <code>0</code> when the player is truely dead.</p>
<pre><code>                if magnitude(playerpos - e.pos) &lt; 1:
                    playerhealth -= gl_delta_time() * 50
                    if playerhealth &lt;= 0:
                        playerhealth = 0
                        highscore = max(highscore, score)
                        playing = false</code></pre>
<p>Then finally, inside our <code>for(enemies) e:</code> loop, we add this bit of code which checks if this particular enemy is “touching” the player. If so, we substract health for how long he is touching. If the player runs out of health, we update the high score, and revert back into non-playing mode.</p>
<p>Game Over, and Tutorial Over!</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">7: What’s next?</h3>
<p>We now have a very basic structure of a game. While it is not impressive, it does deal with all the typical things a game does, and thus extending it from here should be fun and easy. Some ideas of things you could add:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tweak all the current variables: player and enemy speed, enemy health and spawn rates, etc. The current ones are workable defaults, but are they the most fun?</p></li>
<li><p>A variety of enemy types. You can make them differ by speed, size and hitpoints easily, though giving them different behaviors will give even more variety.</p></li>
<li><p>Pickups for the player. Think of randomly spawning health boxes, and powerups (faster fire, spread fire etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Better graphics! It is a very good idea to make a game fun first with geometric shapes like we have done, but then once the game has taken shape, adding graphics can make the game feel more immersive and give better feedback to the player.</p></li>
<li><p>Better UI and main menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Game structure: different levels the player can try to beat, permanent upgrades the player can buy, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-topics-coroutines">8: Advanced Topics: Coroutines</h3>
<p>If you look at the finished code of tut6.lobster, you can notice one problem with game programming: we ended up with a lot of global variables, even for such an absolutely simple game. If a game gets more complicated, this growing set of globals will make our game hard to maintain, and error prone. Just look at the code above that follows <code>if gl_button(&quot;space&quot;) == 1:</code> in the menu code: we need to carefully reset each global that matters for the game, and if we forget one, we have a bug. Generally, the less local variable access is, the harder code is to follow.</p>
<p>So how do we get rid of all these globals? We could stick all these variables in objects. And while that potentially improves some things (we can now initialize all state related to one level in a single object, guaranteeing simulatuous initialization), in the end we’ve replaced our globals with a single global that holds… more globals. Just because we hide things in an object doesn’t make them less global, if there’s only one copy of the variable and it is used everywhere then it is effectively global. The code hasn’t really improved.</p>
<p>Another trick to get rid of globals is to pass things as arguments instead. But looking at the code, there are no opportunities for doing so, since we’d there’s no easy way to pass all these values from one frame to the next, unless we stick them all in one object like before.</p>
<p>And this is really hinting at a deeper problem with games and global state: we have so much global state because <em>we need to remember what we were doing from one frame to the next</em>. Essentially, our programming language gives us great tools to sequence actions (control structures) within a frame, but not across frames. For example, a <code>for</code> loop is very convenient, because it allows us to specify “do this 10 times”, and we don’t have to worry about keeping track of where we are, and all data related to the loop is <em>local</em>. Now you might want to say “do this for the next 10 frames”, and you’ll have no help from the language, you need to keep track of where you are in your iteration manually, and worse, the state related to the loop needs to survive the frame loop, which means it has to be… <em>global</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is that a programming language only has one current execution location, and one stack (where local variables reside for all active function calls). So there’s no way to interrupt a <code>for</code> loop and say, “let’s come back to this loop later”, because your only options are to finish the entire loop right now (which is useless if you want to do it over the next frames) or kill the loop (which also kills the state associated with it).</p>
<p>Coroutines are the feature to fix this. Sadly, for as awesome as they are, they are also very confusing to fully understand (if this section hasn’t confused you already!).</p>
<p>Put simply, a coroutine is a normal function call that can be interrupted, frozen in time, and the later continued where you left of. It’s a bit like a thread, except instead of running code concurrently, it is more like swapping them out. And you determine manually when you want to be interrupted. This has the advantage of being much faster and more predictable than threads. A coroutine determines where it wants to be interrupted by calling its last function argument.</p>
<p>Since you now should fully understand the code of <code>tut6.lobster</code>, load up <code>tut_coro.lobster</code> next to it. It is exactly the same code, with the same game functionality, except it now it is written using coroutines. Notice how there’s only a single global variable left, one that holds either a coroutine that runs the menu, or one that runs the game. As you can see, all coroutines have their internal state as local variables which means when they get interrupted, it remembers exactly where it was, regardless of how complex the control structures you may be inside of. Sadly, in this example, we’re not using that functionality much (because I tried to keep the original game as simple as possible, and exactly to try and reduce the state for the tutorial!), but when complexity grows, the value of having everything locally will grow.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, how you’d program a game object to wander around randomly, then check if it sees the player, and if it does, chase it for 10 seconds, then return to wandering, and otherwise, stand still for a bit. With coroutines, this can programmed using just a couple of (nested) if-then’s and for loops, with everything local to the function. Without, you’d have to write a state machine, tracking all possible behaviors the object can have, and for each behavior, all the variables that indicate it’s current state within that behavior. Additionally, with coroutines such behaviors are easy to abstract into helper functions, since sequencing actions is fairly compositional, whereas with a state machine, the structure of the state machine is possibly different for every game object thus needs to be set up anew.</p>
